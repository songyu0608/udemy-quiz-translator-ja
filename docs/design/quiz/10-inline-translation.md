# Inline Translation

## Layout Selection
Translations are shown to the right of the original when there is room, otherwise below it.
- Input: Answer cards, the nearest scroll container of the cards
- Rule: Free width = scroll container right edge (or viewport) − rightmost card edge − 2 × 16px, measured after the column shift. Side layout when it is at least 240px; box width is the original column width (at least 560px), limited by the free width
- Code: `content.js` → `showInlineTranslations()`, `shiftForSide()`, `sideColumn()`, `scrollParentOf()`
- Architecture: [Overview](../../architecture/10-overview.md#translation-flow)

    A[showInlineTranslations] --> S[shiftForSide]
    S --> B{Free width >= 240px?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Side layout: fixed layer, boxes aligned to originals]
    B -- No --> R[restoreShift] --> D[Below layout: boxes inserted after originals]
    E[scroll or content change] --> H[positionSide]
    H -- no longer fits --> A
    W[resize] --> A
```

Representative scenario:
- Input: 1600px wide window, quiz column 640px, curriculum sidebar on the right
- Steps: `sideColumn()` finds free space inside the main scroll container → `showSideTranslations()`
- Result: Each translation floats to the right of its original and stops before the sidebar
- All scenarios: [Inline Translation Scenarios](../../testing/scenarios/quiz/10-inline-translation.md#inline-translation-scenarios)

## Column Shift
Udemy centers the quiz column, which leaves the left half of the free space unused.
- Code: `centeredColumn()`, `shiftTarget()`, `shiftForSide()`, `shiftIsStale()`, `applyShift()`, `restoreShift()`
- `centeredColumn()` walks up from the first card to the scroll container and picks the innermost ancestor that contains the header and all cards and whose left and right gaps inside its parent are equal (within 4px) and larger than 40px. This covers margin auto, flex, and grid centering
- `shiftForSide()` sets only `margin-left` and `margin-right: auto` (inline, `!important`) so the original plus its translation are centered as a pair, with at least 24px left margin
- The previous inline values are saved and restored by `clearInlineTranslations()`, the below fallback, and `destroy()`
- `positionSide()` calls `shiftIsStale()` on every reposition and rebuilds the layout when the shift is missing or lost: Udemy may finish centering the column after the first render, or re-render the column and drop the override

Observed on Udemy (2026-11-04): `div.quiz-page-layout--scroll-container` is the scroll container; its child (860px) is centered with `margin: 24px auto`. With the curriculum sidebar closed (1751px area) the pair needs 1752px, so the column moves to the 24px minimum margin.

Scenario:
- Input: 2308px wide main area, 688px quiz column centered with 810px on each side
- Steps: `centeredColumn()` finds `#content` → pair width 688 + 32 + 688 → margin-left 450px
- Result: Original at 450px, translation right after it, both centered; no inline style left after `destroy()`

## Layout Diagnosis
`window.udemyLocalTranslator.layoutInfo()` returns the mode, the shifted element, the scroll container, and each ancestor of the first card with width, gaps, display, justify-content, margins, and overflow. Use it when the side placement looks wrong on a real Udemy page.

## Side Layout
- Code: `showSideTranslations()`, `positionSide()`, `relayout()`, `requestRelayout()`
- A `position: fixed` layer (`.uqt-side-layer`, marked with `data-udemy-quiz-inline`) is clipped to the visible part of the scroll container, so boxes never cover a sidebar or the page header
- Each box's top follows its original (`getBoundingClientRect().top`). When a box is taller than its original, the next box is pushed down 8px below it
- Scroll (capture) and content changes reposition boxes once per animation frame; a resize rebuilds the layout from cached translations
- A width change of the scroll container without a resize event (Udemy sidebar opened or closed) makes `positionSide()` return false, which rebuilds the layout so the column shift is recalculated
- An empty spacer (`data-udemy-quiz-inline="spacer"`) after the last answer grows by the amount the boxes overflow below it. Without it, boxes below a short quiz would be clipped and unreachable because the container had nothing to scroll
- Udemy elements are never moved; only the column margins are overridden (see Column Shift) and our own nodes are added. Text color, font family, and font size are copied from the first card

## Below Layout
- Input: `quiz` from `extractQuiz()`, translated question, translated answers
- Output: `.udemy-quiz-inline-translation` elements inserted into the Udemy DOM, each marked with `data-udemy-quiz-inline`
- Code: `content.js` → `showInlineTranslations()`, `makeInlineTranslation()`, `clearInlineTranslations()`
- Steps: Remove previous inline nodes → insert the question translation before the first card → insert each answer translation after its card
- An `<li>` card gets an `<li>` translation so `<ul>`/`<ol>` stay valid
- Architecture: [Overview](../../architecture/10-overview.md#translation-flow)

## Avoiding Self Detection
Injected nodes must not be read back as quiz text or trigger re-translation.
- `findText()` skips text inside inline nodes
- `originalInnerText()` hides inline nodes while reading `innerText`
- The question range clone removes inline nodes before reading text
- `isOwnMutation()` ignores mutations caused by inline nodes

## Re-insertion
Udemy can replace answer elements with identical text. If the content key is unchanged
but the cards are new, `inlineIsCurrent()` returns false and the cached translations
are inserted again without calling the translator. If the cards are current, the side
boxes are only repositioned, because feedback text can change card heights.

Scenario:
- Input: User selects an answer and Udemy re-renders the cards with the same text
- Steps: Observer fires → same key → `inlineIsCurrent()` false → `showInlineTranslations()` with `lastRendered`
- Result: Translations stay visible, no extra translation call
